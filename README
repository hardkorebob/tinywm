Micro window manager implemented in Python3 in as few lines as possible, 
without being obfuscated or entirely useless. It allows you
to move, resize, focus (sloppy), and raise windows. 
To serve as a quick example of some window manager programming basics.

Files:

  tinywm.py

Usage:

  Mod4 = Super [Command] 
  Focus follows pointer.

  Mod4+Button1, drag: interactive window move
  Mod4+Button3, drag: interactive window resize [Right-Click]
  Mod4+Tab:           raise focused window

Suggested Test Environment:
  
  #$HOME/.xinitrc
  xterm &
  while true; do sleep 1000000; done
  
  $ startx
