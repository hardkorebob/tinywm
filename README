Micro window manager implemented in Python3 in as few lines as possible, 
without being obfuscated or entirely useless. It allows you
to move, resize, focus (sloppy), and raise windows -- that's it!  TinyWM's main
purpose is to serve as a quick example of some window manager programming
basics.

Usage:

  Mod4 = Super [Command] 
  Focus follows pointer.

  Mod4+Button1, drag: interactive window move
  Mod4+Button3, drag: interactive window resize [Right-Click]
  Mod4+Tab:           raise focused window
