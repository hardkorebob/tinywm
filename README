Micro window manager implemented in Python3 in as few lines as possible, 
without being obfuscated or entirely useless. It allows you to move, resize, focus (sloppy), and raise windows. 
To serve as a quick example of some window manager programming basics.

Depends:
  python-xlib
  xterm
  xsetroot
  xinit

Usage:

  Mod4 = Super [Command(Mac)] 
  Focus follows pointer.

  Mod4+Button1, drag: interactive window move
  Mod4+Button3, drag: interactive window resize [Right-Click]
  Mod4+Tab:           raise focused window
  Ctrl-q: exit: [pointer over] Python logo

Suggested Test Environment:
  
  #$HOME/.xinitrc
    xsetroot -solid dimgray
    xterm &
    while true; do sleep 1000000; done
  
  $ startx
  $_python3 /path/to/twmapp.py &


Recommended Play Env:

  $ mv twmapp.py /usr/local/bin
  $ pkill X

  #$HOME/.xinitrc
    xsetroot -solid dimgray
    exec twmapp.py

  $ startx
